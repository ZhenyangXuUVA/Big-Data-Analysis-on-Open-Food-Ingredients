Big Data Analysis on Open Food Ingredients using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

## Introduction
With the increasing needs for daily cosmetic products these years, cosmetic product marketing is a promising industry and attracts lots of investments. However, one central problem that remains unsolved is how to effectively promote cosmetic products to target customers. In this project, we will extract and analyze datasets from the following data source: Open Beauty Facts(https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openbeautyfacts). The Open Beauty Facts is a database consisting of information about cosmetic products with ingredients, allergens, inventories and all tidbits of information on product labels.

## Goals
Intend to study with this project/Objectives:
1. We want to help consumers make informed decisions about their cosmetic product purchases by identifying the common ingredients and allergens in cosmetic products.
2. We want to cluster cosmetic products based on their common ingredients using K-means clustering to help recommend similar products.
3. The ultimate goal of this project is to build a model for clustering cosmetic products in Open Beauty Facts, so we can help different consumers to select different target products to meet their needs.
4. K-means clustering method along with other clustering methods for product classification. Machine learning methods such as random tree forest may also be used in this project for classification.
